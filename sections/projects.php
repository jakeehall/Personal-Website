    <p>
      Do you like gambling? Don't bother wasting your money when you can play Keno, a lotto-like game, online
      for free. To play, select between 1 and 10 different numbers of your choice, then cross your fingers and
      hope that your number(s) are selected from the 20 number drawn. I programmed this game using nothing more
      than the HTML5 standards, this way no downloads or programs besides your web browser are needed!

    <a class="try" href="../projects/MathCards/" target="_blank">Math Flash Cards</a><a class="source" href="https://github.com/jakeehall/MathLearningTables" target="_blank"></a>
    <p>
      After first learning object oriented JavaScript I wrote a simple program for elementary students to start
      learning simple math by using online flash cards. This way anyone could learn basic math for free and
      also be amused by the automation and randomness of online flash cards. This program allows parents,
      teachers, or users to set what kinds of math they would like to be tested on as well as the range of
      numbers they would like to work with. After completing each problem the users score, percentage, and
      grade will all be shown in real time.

  <h2>Websites</h2>

    <a class="source" href="https://github.com/jakeehall/personal-website" target="_blank">JakeHall.me</a>
    <p>
      Well duh, right? Yes, I created and designed this entire website using the some of the latest web
      technologies including: PHP, HTML, SCSS/Sass (a CSS pre-processor very similar to LESS), and JavaScript
      with use of the JQuery Library. There are some very modern style choices I used while developing this
      website, such as page animations, as well as smooth scrolling features when a navigation link is clicked.
      But wait, there's more! This website is also responsive to create a better viewing experience on
      smaller-screened devices.

    <h3>TechBooters.com</h3>
    <p>
      Dedicated to supplying the latest news in the tech world, Tech Booters was know for working closely with
      independent inventors and developers to showcase lesser-known projects. Tech Booters quickly became a
      dependable source for not only news, but also for indie company's to release their latest creations. The
      website also hosted its own video gaming podcast, "The Boot," along with un-boxing videos of the latest
      products on the market.

    <p>
      As part of the Software Engineering course at Colorado Mesa University, I was set with the task to find
      a local business and create a piece of software to fit their needs. The Point is a local Restaurant and
      Bar, located on the Colorado Mesa University campus run by students. In order to take advantage of the
      growing food industries needs for technology, I built an iPhone application for customers to engage with.
      Using a unique user interface design, I created easy-to-use application that would allow customers to
      view menus, order food, view upcoming events, and get rewarded for purchases, all from their own iPhone.
