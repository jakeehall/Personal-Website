    <p>
      Do you like gambling, or have you never tried? Don't bother wasting your money when you can play Keno,
      a lotto-like game, online for free. To play, select between 1 and 10 diffrent numbers of your choice,
      then cross your fingers and hope that your number(s) are selected from the 20 number drawn. I programmed
      this game using nothing more than the HTML5 standards, this way no downloads or programs besides your
      web browser are needed!

    <p>
      Well duh, right? Yes, I created and designed this entire website using the some of the latest web
      technologies including: PHP, HTML, SCSS/Sass (a CSS pre-processor very similar to LESS), and JavaScript
      with use of the JQuery Library. There are some very modern style choices I used while developing this
      website, such as page animations, as well as smooth scrolling features when a navagation link is clicked.
      But wait, there's more! This website is also responsive to create a better viewing experience on
      smaller-screened devices.

    <h3>TechBooters.com</h3>
    <p>
      Dedicated to supplying the latest news in the tech world, Tech Booters was know for working closely with
      independent inventors and developers to showcase lesser-known projects. Tech Booters quickly became a
      dependable source for not only news, but also for indie companys to relese their latest creations. The
      website also hosted its own video gaming podcast, "The Boot," along with un-boxing videos of the latest
      products on the market.
