  <h2>Hello World!</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Jake Hall and I'm a developer. At a young age I became very intrested with technology.
    Everytime I visited a website my curiousioty grew stronger, and I wanted to know how to create my
    own space on the internet. When I was twelve years old I created my first website to share some of
    my favorite flash games with the kids in my elementry school. After a while of updating my site, I
    wanted to broaden my skill set by learning HTML on my own, this way I would no longer depend on
    other websites to provide the tools I needed to build my personal web space. This was my first
    introduction to the world of programming.

    Later on when I was in middle school I became an avid video gamer and decided that I would like
    to start making my own games. Luckly my school offered a basic computer class where students learned
    how to type and use diffrent Microsoft Office tools, however the big draw for me to join the class
    was that it also taught students how to make basic flash games in a program called "Klick &amp; Play."
    I had a great time making games not only in class but also in my free time at home. I made some great
    little games with that software but the problem was I couldn't share them with other people easily.
    So I took to the internet and began joing diffrent programming communities and meeting other
    programers that were willing to help me learn the ropes. Soon after I had developed my first game,
    in the form of homebrew, for my PlayStation Portable. It was just a basic Simion Says game written
    in Lua, but again I had reached another milestone in my developing life.

    By the time I was in high school I already had a solid foundation for web design and programming logic,
    but since I was lucky enough to have a high school that offered multiple web design and programming
    classes at that time, I decided it would by a good idea for me to strengthen some of my favorite skills
    even further. I took Web Design one through four, aswell as a Java programing class. In my classes we
    published our own websites and created our own graphical user interfaced projects.

    I had no trouble deciding what I would like to go to college for, so I applied and was accepted into
    Colorado Mesa University's Computer Science program. Throughout my studies at college I was challanged
    more than ever before to create the largest and most efficient programs yet. I never backed down from
    any challange though, as every project that I finished gave me a renewed sence of accomplishment. During
    university I presented two large scale projects at Colorado Mesa University's anual Student Showcase,
    where students are encouraged to show some of their outside of school work while being enrolled as a
    full-time student, in front of an audience of local community members and a panel of judges. Although
    I was nervous to present my programs in front of an audience, I was also very excited because of the
    oppurtunity I had to work on my public speaking and presentation skills. Some would say I'm a bit
    obsessed with learning new skills and perfecting old ones, but the way I view my field this is an
    essinal talent to keep up with the newest and greatest technology!
